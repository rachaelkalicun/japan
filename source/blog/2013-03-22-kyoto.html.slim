      h2 Day 7 - Sunday – Kyoto
      p We left Takayama early in the morning and took the slow train back to Nagoya. There we boarded a shinkansen for Kyoto.
      p 
       ' Upon arriving in Kyoto, we checked into our hotel, 
       a  href="http://www.hotel-vista.jp/kyoto/index_e.html" target="_blank" title="Hotel Vista Kyoto" Hotel Vista Kyoto
       ' , which is directly behind the train station. The room was extremely small and it was not very cheerful, but it was fine for sleeping. 
      p After checking in, we set out for the afternoon.
      p 
       ' First we went to the magnificent

       ' which houses the impressive Thousand Armed Kannon statues.

      p Following this, we went to the old district of Gion where geishas still live. We were looking for a place to eat dinner but were uninformed and couldn't find anything.

       ' We continued walking down Shijo-dori which is a shopping area. We explored side streets looking for a restaurant. Finally we gave up and decided to walk back towards the hotel, hungry. Near the hotel, we found an Irish pub,

       '  in Karasuma. While it was expensive (about $10 for pints of beer), it was a great change. I had fish and chips while Vlod had vegetarian pizza. It wasn't the best food, but we appreciated the effort.  
      h2 Day 8 – Monday – Kyoto – Philosophers Walk
      p 
        ' We had a quick breakfast of cereal followed by pastries from the shop at Kyoto Station and then headed to the Philosopher's Walk via the subway from Kyoto Station to Keage Station. 
        a href="http://goo.gl/JCJ8a" target="_blank" Here's a good video
        '  on using the subway.
      p This is a beautiful path that passes many temples and shrines. 
      p We visited Nanzen-ji Temple.

        ' Ginkakuji Temple
      p At the end of the path, we weren't close to any trains or subways and had no idea about the buses so we continued to walk. We walked along Imadegawa-Dori. When we got near Doshisha University, we saw several restaurants and had a late lunch at an Indian Restaurant. It was very good food. You could pick the spicy level and Vlod picked the maximum number of chilis. The owner was impressed. He gave us some free chai. 
      p We turned left on Teramachi-Dori and walked past Imperial Park. It was a pretty bland walk. We walked back to the shopping district and went into the large department store Daimaru. I checked out the amazing food court and looked at the impressive area of housewares. 
      p 
       ' We mosied back towards the hotel for some rest and did some research for dinner. We started with beer at

       '  inside the Isetan Department Store (9th Floor) at Kyoto Station. We had some excellent fries with it (but very small). Then we found a pizza place inside Kyoto Yodobashi Building. It was superb pizza. While the name isn't clear (might be called M&S), if you go to the 6th floor in the building, you'll find it.

      h2 Day 10 – Wednesday – Kyoto
      p On our last day in Kyoto, we took the subway to Kita-Oji. We walked to Daitokuji Temple, Kinkaku-ji, and Ryoan-ji.

      p We walked to Hanazono JR Station where we took a short ride to Niro Station to go to Niro Castle. After exiting the station, we asked a young guy which way the castle was. He escorted us all the way and was really interested in trying to speak with us.
